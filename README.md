# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-
Here we are solving an image classification problem, where our goal will be to tell which class the input image belongs to. The way we are going to achieve it is by training an artificial neural network on few thousand images of cats and dogs and make the NN(Neural Network) learn to predict which class the image belongs to, next time it sees an image having a cat or dog in it.

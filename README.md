# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-
Here we are solving an image classification problem, where our goal will be to tell which class the input image belongs to. The way we are going to achieve it is by training an artificial neural network on few thousand images of cats and dogs and make the NN(Neural Network) learn to predict which class the image belongs to, next time it sees an image having a cat or dog in it.
Project is divided into three parts- Preprocessing, Feature extraction and Prediction.Python software used for implementation of this project.  
Predictive Analytics performed using Python.Intensity values of image were taken as data and applied modeling techniques with Logistic Regression (Classification), Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Deep Learning, Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Feedback Neural Network (FNN). Validated models using ROC and AUC techniques. Currently working on increasing the accuracy by using Deep Learning techniques on GPUs.
